## Weather App based on openweathermap.org API with React

## To do:
- Create placeholder image to cities without assigned picture
- Add time zones by calculating time zone using lon and lat
- Work with opacity relative to time in city (at night darker overlay, at day lighter overlay)
- Add one field with search input to type in city
- Button to change between metric system, kelvin, fahrenheit, m/s to miles per hour
- Tweak graphic design to something like so:

## Done:
- Connect to API and fetch data
- Split to weather segments to display weather in different cities
- Display detailed data about weather after click at city segment eg. pressure, wind direction, visibility etc.
- Add weather overlay (rain, snow, sun)
- Assign picture to major cities (London, New York, Warsaw, Moscow etc.)
- Change background-image to img
- Handle error codes (maybe different bg? - sad face :( )
- RWD
